## Types of Diagrams

UML uses various views to represent the blueprint of a final project from different angles. Every UML diagram carries a special purpose, meaning and representation.

As of UML version 2, there are **_14 types_** of diagrams divided into 2 main categories:

- [Structural](./Structural/README.md)
- Behavioral

### Structural

**_Structural diagrams_** represent the **_static aspect_** of the system and emphasizes the things, must be present in the system being modeled. Since this diagram represents the structure, they are used frequently in documenting the software architecture.

### Behavioral

**_Behavioral diagrams_** show how the system works **_in motion_**. That is how the system interacts with external entities and users, how it responds to input or events and what constraints it operates under. Since these diagrams explain about the behavior of the system, they are used extensively to describe the functionality of a software system.

Each diagram should be considered as a chapter in the story and together they create a complete picture of the system being built.
